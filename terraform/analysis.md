# Terraform Implementation Analysis

## Current Implementation vs Requirements

### 1. VPC & Networking
**Current:**
- VPC with public and private subnets across 2 AZs ✓
- Internet Gateway for public subnets ✓
- NAT Gateways for private subnets (not cost-optimal) ✗
- Bastion host in public subnet ✓
- S3 Gateway Endpoint in VPC ✓
- Security groups for ALB, EC2, RDS, Bastion ✓

**Requirements:**
- VPC with public and private subnets across 2 AZs ✓
- Internet Gateway for public subnets ✓
- Bastion host in public subnet to access private RDS ✓
- S3 Gateway Endpoint in VPC to avoid NAT costs ✓
- Security groups: ALB → EC2 (HTTP/HTTPS), EC2 → RDS (MySQL 3306), Bastion → RDS (MySQL 3306), EC2 egress to LLM API IPs and S3 ✓

**Gaps:**
- Remove NAT Gateways to optimize costs
- Add specific egress rules for LLM API IPs

### 2. Compute
**Current:**
- Auto Scaling Group with min=1, max=3 ✗
- EC2 instances in private subnet behind ALB ✓
- No instance profile with IAM role for SSM + S3 access ✗

**Requirements:**
- Single EC2 instance (t3.micro, free-tier) in private subnet behind ALB ✓
- Optionally use an Auto Scaling Group min=1, max=2 (future-proofing) ✗
- Instance profile with IAM role for SSM + S3 access ✗

**Gaps:**
- Add IAM role for SSM and S3 access
- Adjust ASG to min=1, max=2

### 3. Database
**Current:**
- RDS MySQL instance in private subnet, single-AZ, encrypted ✓
- Parameter group & security group attached ✓
- Automated backups enabled ✓
- Access only from EC2 or Bastion host ✓

**Requirements:**
- RDS MySQL instance in private subnet, single-AZ, free-tier, encrypted ✓
- Parameter group & security group attached ✓
- Automated backups enabled ✓
- Access only from EC2 or Bastion host ✓

**Gaps:**
- Ensure free-tier eligible instance class

### 4. Application & Auth
**Current:**
- No user auth via Cognito ✗
- No app secrets stored in SSM Parameter Store ✗

**Requirements:**
- Go server deployment via EC2 ✓
- User auth via Cognito (user pool + JWT verification in app) ✗
- App secrets stored in SSM Parameter Store (DB credentials, LLM API keys) ✗

**Gaps:**
- Add Cognito user pool
- Add SSM Parameter Store resources

### 5. ALB & TLS
**Current:**
- ALB in public subnets ✓
- Listener on HTTPS with ACM certificate ✓
- Forward to EC2 instances in private subnet ✓

**Requirements:**
- ALB in public subnets ✓
- Listener on HTTPS with ACM certificate ✓
- Forward to EC2 instances in private subnet ✓

**Gaps:**
- None

### 6. CI/CD
**Current:**
- No GitHub Actions workflows ✗
- No OIDC GitHub Actions → AWS for credentials ✗

**Requirements:**
- GitHub Actions workflows:
  - Terraform: plan + apply to S3 remote state with DynamoDB lock ✗
  - App deployment: build Go binary, deploy to EC2 via SSM Run Command ✗
- Use OIDC GitHub Actions → AWS for credentials ✗

**Gaps:**
- Add GitHub Actions workflows
- Add OIDC integration

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
**Current:**
- CloudWatch alarms for ASG scaling ✓
- No specific CloudWatch logs for EC2 & Go app ✗
- No specific CloudWatch metrics & alarms for CPU, memory, disk, RDS storage, request errors ✗

**Requirements:**
- CloudWatch logs for EC2 & Go app ✗
- CloudWatch metrics & alarms: CPU, memory, disk, RDS storage, request errors ✗

**Gaps:**
- Add CloudWatch logging configuration
- Add additional CloudWatch alarms

### 8. Cost Optimization
**Current:**
- Uses t3.micro instances ✓
- Has NAT Gateways (not cost-optimal) ✗
- No S3 lifecycle rules ✗

**Requirements:**
- Use smallest free-tier instances and resources ✓
- No NAT Gateway (use public subnet for outbound + S3 VPC Endpoint) ✗
- S3 lifecycle rules ✗

**Gaps:**
- Remove NAT Gateways
- Add S3 lifecycle rules
