# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Event Storming to UML Generator

## 1. Product Overview

This product is an AI-powered tool that automates the transformation of business process descriptions into structured Event Storming models and UML diagrams. The tool addresses the current gap in domain analysis workflows by providing an end-to-end solution that goes from natural language business process descriptions to visual system models.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- Eliminates manual transformation of sticky notes to system models
- Reduces information loss during domain analysis
- Accelerates time-to-model by 2-3x compared to manual methods
- Provides AI-assisted modeling for consistent, high-quality results

**Target Users:**
- Business Analysts
- Domain Experts
- Software Architects
- Development Teams
- Product Managers

## 2. User Problem

Event Storming is a proven method for domain analysis, but its results typically remain as unstructured sticky notes on physical or digital boards. Teams currently face significant challenges when transforming this information into formal system models:

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Time-Consuming Manual Process:** Teams must manually interpret and structure sticky notes into UML diagrams
- **Information Loss:** Critical details and relationships are often lost during manual transformation
- **Inconsistency:** Different team members may interpret the same sticky notes differently
- **Skill Gap:** Not all team members are proficient in UML modeling
- **Iteration Difficulty:** Changes in business requirements require rebuilding entire model structures

**Business Impact:**
- Delayed project timelines due to manual modeling work
- Reduced model quality and accuracy
- Increased risk of miscommunication between business and technical teams
- Higher costs for domain analysis phase
